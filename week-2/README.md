# ⚡ EEDC Energy Cap Analysis (Jan–May 2025)

This project is part of my 8-month AI/ML learning journey. I explored energy cap data from the Enugu Electricity Distribution Company (EEDC) to practice data wrangling, analysis, and visualization using **NumPy**, **Pandas**, and **Streamlit**.

## 🧠 Project Goals

- Strengthen my understanding of NumPy and Pandas
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on real-world data
- Build a simple dashboard using Streamlit
- Communicate findings in a clear, actionable report

---

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset includes monthly energy caps for various business units under EEDC from **January to May 2025**.

**Key features:**
- Month
- Business unit
- Energy cap (MWh)

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy & Pandas
- Streamlit
- Matplotlib/Seaborn (optional)
- Google Sheets / PDF for reporting

---

## 🚀 What I Built

- **EDA notebook** for data cleaning, transformation, and insight generation
- **Streamlit dashboard** to display:
  - Monthly trends across business units
  - Energy cap distribution
- **Report** summarizing key insights and recommendations

## 📈 Key Insights

- Some business units consistently receive lower energy caps than others
- There are noticeable monthly fluctuations in cap distribution
- Possible optimization areas for resource allocation

---

## 📝 Next Steps

- Add interactive visualizations
- Move toward predictive modeling as I learn ML
