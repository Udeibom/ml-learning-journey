# 🧠 Hands-On Machine Learning: Chapters 1–7

Welcome! This repo documents my work from **Chapters 1 to 7** of *Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow* by Aurélien Géron.

This is part of my 8-month AI/ML journey, where I’m learning in public and building a solid foundation in supervised learning.
